			<h1>The Election of the Liberal Government</h1>
			<p>The 1890 election of the Liberal Government in New Zealand has called a watershed election, as it resulted in a marked change in the political and economic direction of the country as well as having a major impact on people’s lives.</p>

			<h2>The growth of pastoralism</h2>
				<p>A number of economic and political reasons were instrumental in bringing a change of government in 1890. The growth of pastoralism from the 1850’s saw the emergence of an economic elite, especially along the east coast of the South Island. These men, helped by the accessibility of cheap loans and leases developed large monopolies over land ownership (in 1882 just under one third of the farmland in New Zealand was owned by 247 people and companies). Such statistics were a depressing prospect for immigrant farmers looking to get started on the land. Political support seemed essential for them to realise their dreams.</p>

			<h2>Policies of Julius Vogel</h2>
				<h3>Borrowing</h3>
				<p>The policies of Julius Vogel, Colonial Treasurer in the Fox government, were an underlying cause of the emergence of the Liberals. Vogel borrowed 10 million pounds in the 1870’s to develop roads, railways, and immigration. This was a bold attempt to develop the infrastructure necessary for growth in an infant colony. Vogel’s scheme certainly laid the basis for future New Zealand development, but by the late 1870’s the economy began to suffer as debt repayment and falling prices saw the New Zealand economy plunge into recession.</p>
				<h3>Provincial system</h3>
				<p>One policy of Vogel’s which did also help the emergence of the Liberals was his abolition of the provincial system of government in 1876. As a result of this decision, power was centralised in Wellington, and the old provincial system discarded. Unfortunately however, soon after the abolition of the provinces, the economy began to stagnate. An opportunity for central government to solve economic problems was wasted. Strategies like tax increases, retrenchment and work relief schemes simply put men out of work. Unemployment caused many people to look for an answer and a political party that promised a better life. The Liberal Party claimed to have answers to the problems people faced.</p>

			<h2>The Depression of the 1880’s</h2>
				<p>The Depression which developed in the 1880’s was the result of the collapse of the Glasgow Bank, together with a drop in the price of wool and a steady decline in gold output. For the first time New Zealand witnessed vagrancy, high unemployment, slum housing and general poverty. Most notably, the emergence of sweated labour where women and children were exploited in factories for very little money came to symbolise the poor conditions working people were facing. Again, developments like sweating and general poverty were a direct consequence of the failed economic policies of successive governments, and a cause of the election of the Liberal Government. Retrenchment and tax increases were short-term measures which would clearly not work.</p>

			<h2>A breakdown of social ideals</h2>
				<p>A final, but certainly not least important cause of the election of the Liberal Government involved the social ideals of most Pakeha New Zealanders who wished to avoid the ‘evils of the old world’ in their new homeland. The 1880’s proved a sad disappointment for many, however. Labour abuse and ‘sweating’ in New Zealand harked back to conditions in England. Charitable aid boards and state care facilities were also present in New Zealand and something new settlers had hoped to leave behind. Finally, the settlers wanted land to be accessible to the ‘small man’. They specifically wanted to avoid a situation where land was the domain of a few monopolists. Their disappointment can be imagined when they discovered that large areas of land were indeed ‘locked up’ in large sheep stations. The Liberals promised these issues, and this was a further cause of their election success in 1890.</p>

			<h2>The 1890 election</h2>
				<p>In the 1890 General Election, the national issues at stake were privilege and monopoly. In the public mind the incumbent Atkinson was associated with the political era that protected these rural interests. He was defeated by John Ballance and a loosely organised group of relatively ‘new men’ like John McKenzie, William Pember-Reeves and Richard Seddon, who had an agreed policy on land and labour reform. Their support came from the urban middle class and the forces of labour. The election of the Liberal Party had an immediate effect on people's’ lives. The Liberals had been voted into power with the promise and hope that they would bring about change in the economic, political and social structure of New Zealand. Subsequent events were to deliver these hopes for most nineteenth century New Zealanders.</p>

			<h2>Liberal policies</h2>
				<h3>Working policies</h3>
				<p>Once in power the Liberals began to pass a number of laws that would change people’s lives for the better. Workers would now be able to work fewer hours in safe working conditions thanks to the Factory Act of 1894 which regulated working conditions. Another act, the Labour Department Act, provided for inspectors to inspect working conditions in factories. The Truck Act also helped workers by making sure that workers were paid in cash, not in kind (or goods) as had been the case earlier.</p>
				<h3>Land policies</h3>
				<p>Whilst workers were being looked after and ‘sweating’ came to end, the power of the big landowners was being challenged by the Lands for Settlement Act of 1892 which taxed large estates and allowed the Government to buy them (for example the hugh Cheviot Estate in the South Island), and break them into smaller farms. This not only helped the government to buy up large estates, but allowed men and women the opportunity to move onto land bought or leased from the government. Acts like the Advances to Settlers Act enabled them to realise their dreams.</p>
				<p>The development of ‘the small farm’ was a challenge to the political power of the farmers who owned large amounts of land. The growing numbers of small farmers helped by Liberal policies saw the power structure of New Zealand change to allow the emergence of a new political voice.</p>
				<p>People were assisted to get started into farming, and in the longer term the economy was boosted, especially after the introduction of refrigeration in the 1880’s. New Zealand’s development as a food-exporting primary producer stems from this period, and further emphasises this enlightened Liberal decision.</p>
				<h3>Further policies</h3>
				<p>Not only the small farmer and the factory worker were to be helped as a result of the election of the Liberal Party. All New Zealanders were to benefit from the introduction of the old age pension. Indeed, the benefits of the pension were carried on by subsequent governments and are a vital part of New Zealand society today. Similarly, the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act set up an enlightened means of ending industrial disputes and encouraged the growth of trade unions. The IC and A Court existed well into the twentieth century and is seen as a landmark in labour relations.</p>
				<p>Not all New Zealanders fared well under Liberal legislation however. During the 1890’s the government passed laws which enabled it to acquire a further 2.7 million acres of Māori land. By 1897 about 20,000 Pakeha settlers were farming on 200,000 acres of Māori land. This land loss was extremely significant to rural-based Māori. It destroyed chiefly structures and marginalised Māori even more from mainstream New Zealand. Grievances arising from land loss for Māori are still pursued in Land Courts and tribunals today, another unfortunate example of historical continuity in the 19th and 20th centuries. Old Age Pensions and the IC and A Act can also be seen as important examples of continuity in New Zealand society, as both outlasted the Liberal Government into the 20th century.</p>
