			<h1>The Struggle for Sovereignty</h1>
			<p>A significant historical trend was the so called 'struggle for sovereignty' in the the 19th century in New Zealand. Prior to the 19th century, Europeans and the native Māori had had a chequered past, from a miunderstanding between explorer Abel Tasman's crew and Māori to the successful nature of trade. Over the 19th century, forces such as the Treaty of Waitangi to the New Zealand wars would prove to affect both the Maori and the Pakeha people.</p>
			<h2>The Treaty of Waitangi</h2>
			<p>A highly significant force that affected the peace of New Zealand was the signing of what many perceive to be New Zealand's founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
			<h3>Why was the Treaty signed?</h3>
			<p>The Treaty of Waitangi was created in order to facilitate an agreement between the Māori and the English. The English wished to lay claim to New Zealand in order to stop oncoming French claimants and create law and order to protect the newly arriving settlers organised by the New Zealand Company in England, whcih was headed by Edward Gibbon Wakefield.</p>
			<h3>Problems with the Treaty</h3>
			<p>However, translation issues in the hastily comprised Treaty meant that English and Māori were left having two differing ideas about what the Treaty actually meant. For example, in the First Article where Māori were to cede their sovereignty, sovereignty was incorrectly translated to <em>kawanatanga</em>, rather than <em>rangatiratanga. Kawanatanga</em> roughly translated to 'governorship' in Māori. This meant that Māori thought they would be protected by the actions of the Governor, Hobson. However the British believed they had complete control over Māori governance.</p>
			<p>Additionally, the British right of preemption was translated as <em>hokonga.</em> Māori interpreted this as the first right of refusal. They believed that they could offer their land to the British, but then sell it on afterwards. However to the British the right of preemption meant that the Māori could onlys sell to the British exclusively. </p>
