			<h1>The Struggle for Sovereignty</h1>
			<p>A significant historical trend was the so called 'struggle for sovereignty' in the the 19th century in New Zealand. Prior to the 19th century, Europeans and the native Māori had had a chequered past, from a miunderstanding between explorer Abel Tasman's crew and Māori to the successful nature of trade. Over the 19th century, forces such as the Treaty of Waitangi to the New Zealand wars would prove to affect both the Māori and the Pakeha people.</p>

			<h2>The Treaty of Waitangi</h2>
				<p>A highly significant force that affected the peace of New Zealand was the signing of what many perceive to be New Zealand's founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
				<h3>Why was the Treaty signed?</h3>
				<p>The Treaty of Waitangi was created in order to facilitate an agreement between the Māori and the English. The English wished to lay claim to New Zealand in order to stop oncoming French claimants and create law and order to protect the newly arriving settlers organised by the New Zealand Company in England, whcih was headed by Edward Gibbon Wakefield.</p>
				<h3>Problems with the Treaty</h3>
				<p>Translation issues in the hastily comprised Treaty meant that English and Māori were left having two differing ideas about what the Treaty actually meant. For example, in the First Article where Māori were to cede their sovereignty, sovereignty was incorrectly translated to <em>kawanatanga</em>, rather than <em>rangatiratanga. Kawanatanga</em> roughly translated to 'governorship' in Māori. This meant that Māori thought they would be protected by the actions of the Governor, Hobson. However the British believed they had complete control over Māori governance.</p>
				<p>Additionally, the British right of preemption was translated as <em>hokonga.</em> Māori interpreted this as the first right of refusal. They believed that they could offer their land to the British, but then sell it on afterwards. However to the British the right of preemption meant that the Māori could only sell to the British exclusively. </p>

			<h2>The role of the governors in the 1840's</h2>
				<p>Following the annexation of New Zealand, the Colonial Office in Britain exercised authority by proxy through a Governor. In reality this authority was at first restricted to isolated spheres of Pakeha influence, mainly in the north of the North Island. These areas were known as beach-heads.</p>
				<h3>The Wasteland Issue</h3>
				<p>New Zealand's first Governor, William Hobson, was instructed by the Colonial Office to assume control of wastleland for the Crown. The Crown interpreted 'wasteland' to mean all land that was not cultivated or occupied. For Māori there was no such thing as wasteland. All land was <em>turangawaewae</em> and had a purpose. A later Governor, Governor Grey, who was known as the 'hitman of colonialisation' used the poicy of wasteland to seize 30 million acres of the South Island, and 3 million acres of the North Island. This allowed Pakeha authority to move beyond the beachheads, and move into the interior of New Zealand./p>
				<h3>Investigation of pre-1840 land purchases</h3>
				<p>There was considerable Māori and Pakeha concern over the Governor's investigation of pre-1840 land claims. Simple claims up to 2560 acres were allowed if the Land Claims Commissioner determined that the land had been fairly purchased. For claims exceeding this amount, the excess was deemed surplus land and became the property of the Crown.</p>
				<h3>Māori subject to English law</h3>
				<p>In addition to this, Māori became subject to English law. A example of this was in the case of a murderer called Maketu. In accordance with English law, he was hanged for his crimes. In Māori culture, he would have most likely been banished instead. This incident made Māori question the respect of their customs by settlers.</p>

			<h2>The creation of the Settler Government</h2>
				<p>The British settlers who arrived in New Zealand after its annexation brought with them the expectation of self-government following a British pattern. Accordingly they began to lobby the Governor and the Colonial Office in Britain for a constitution that would allow them the limited self-government enjoyed in other colonies.</p>
				<h3>The 1852 Constitution Act</h3>
				<p>Ultimately a constitution was written in 1846 and presented to the Colonial Office for consideration. An amended form of the 1846 Constitution was eventually passed in 1852, once the Māori and Pakeha populations were eventually at numerical balance. The 1852 Constitution Act was significant for Māori-Pakeha relations because:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Māori lost the protection of the Governor and for many this had been a major reason for signing the Treaty of Waitangi.</li>
					<li>The franchise was based on an individual title for land. In practice this excluded Māori who did not have Pakeha-style written titles for property and who 'owned' land communually from a proper share in the exercise of power in New Zealand.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Result of the creation of the settler government</h3>
				<p>The above factors ensured a settler government whose concern was for settler interests. Māori were effectively excluded from the machinery of the Pakeha state.</p>

			<h2>The formation of the Kingitanga</h2>
				<p>As Māori uneasiness with Pakeha threats to their authority grew, Māori began to seek a different way to assert their sovereignty, through the creation of the <em>Kingitanga</em> movement.</p>
				<h3>How was it created?</h3>
				<p>In the early 1850's a series of tribal <em>runanga</em> were held to discuss <em>kotahitanga</em> (self-government). From them emerged the desire for <em>pupuri whenua</em> (retention of land). It was decided that this could be achieved by placing the <em>mana</em> of all tribes under the <em>mana</em> of a King. Additionally, the King's responsibilites would extend to providing law and order as many Māori had complained that the Governor had failed to do so.</p>
				<p>The great Waikato chief <em>Te Wherowhero</em> was crowned King Potatau I in 1858, and was succeeded by his son <em>Tawhiao</em>. A large section of the North Island looked to the King as their authority figure, excluding the <em>Nga Puhi</em>.</p>
				<h3>What were the effects of the creation of the Kingitanga?</h3>
				<p>The creation of the Kingitanga essentially created separate zones of Māori and Pakeha authority. Neither the settlers nor the Government were pleased. Governor Gore-Browne felt threatened by this direct challenge to British sovereignty, and many settlers regarded the Kingitanga as a land league that would impede their acquisition of land.</p>
				<p>In 1860 Gore-Browne called the <em>Kohimarama</em> conference attended by 200 chiefs. Gore-Browne hoped to divide Māori loyalties by gaining the chiefs' condemnation of the Kingitanga. Instead those Māori present at Kohimarama showed that they shared a common understanding that the Treaty guaranteed their <em>mana</em>. They viewed the Kingitanga as a legitimate expression of Māori authority guaranteed by the Treaty.</p>
				<p>The meeting produced the Kohimarama Covenant in which signatories pledged to do nothing inconsistent with their declared recognition of the Queen's sovereignty, essentially undermining the Kingite movement. For Māori, the Queen's representatives in New Zealand had nominal sovereignty, whereas the Government believed theiur substantive sovereignty had been reaffirmed.</p>

			<h2>The New Zealand Land Wars 1860-72</h2>
				<p>One way in which Māori and Pakeha competed for sovereignty was through warfare. The wars of the 1840's had been limited and localised. They were concluded in a way that did not compromise the <em>mana</em> of either side. In contrast, the wars of the 1860-72 period </p>
