			<h1>The Struggle for Sovereignty</h1>
			<p>A significant historical trend was the so called 'struggle for sovereignty' in the the 19th century in New Zealand. Prior to the 19th century, Europeans and the native Māori had had a chequered past, from a miunderstanding between explorer Abel Tasman's crew and Māori to the successful nature of trade. Over the 19th century, forces such as the Treaty of Waitangi to the New Zealand wars would prove to affect both the Maori and the Pakeha people.</p>
			<h2>The Treaty of Waitangi</h2>
			<p>A highly significant force that affected the peace of New Zealand was the signing of what many perceive to be New Zealand's founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi</p>
			<h3>Why was the Treaty signed?</h3>
			<p>The Treaty of Waitangi was created in order to facilitate an agreement between the Māori and the English. The English wished to lay claim to New Zealand in order to stop oncoming French claimants and create law and order to protect the newly arriving settlers organised by the New Zealand Company in England, whcih was headed by Edward Gibbon Wakefield.</p>
